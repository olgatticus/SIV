# Detection of Recaptured Images from LCD Screens 

Final project for the *Signal, Image and Video* course at University of Trento (M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence Systems).

## Description

The goal of the project is to detect whether an image is an original one or if it is a recapture of
an already existing image showed on a LCD screen. In fact, one particular problem addressed by
image forensics is that nowadays, with the increasing popularity and quality of digital cameras,
everyone can take a picture of an already existing one and use this recaptured image for bad and
illegal purposes. In order to deal with such problem, a mathematical tool is used to distinguish between single captured images (i.e., real-world scenes captured by a
digital camera) and recaptured images from LCD screens (i.e., single captured images displayed on
a LCD screen and then recaptured by a digital camera).

In our project, we followed the approach proposed by *Wang, K. (2017). A simple and effective image-statistics-based approach to detecting recaptured images from LCD screens. Digital Investigation, 23, 75-87*.
